# CadÃª O que?

Experiment with GMAPS3 jQuery Plugin and Google Places API. Built with PHP and Code Igniter with Bootstrap 3, the experiment tries to ease the process of finding the best places around the user's location, filtering by range, type of business and reviewer's ratings. Only filtering by type of places is already implemented. There are various things to do and the TODO list should be updated soon, if you find the interest to experiment and contribute, feel free to write me a line if there are no list available yet. In the meantime, im organizing the code for better readability and translating comments to english.
